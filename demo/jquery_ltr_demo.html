            <p>It's also worth noting that many of the weapons you see in this feature are Prestige Weapons, which are higher-priced special skinned versions of normal weapons you can purchase with in-game money or real money. If you'd prefer, you can purchase a standard non-skinned equivalent of the same weapon in the shop for cheaper and without the fancier attachments. Regardless of which version of each weapon you choose to get, we stand by their quality and functionality. </p>
            <p>This includes games that have received a score of 8 or higher on GameSpot since the console's release, as well as reviews for new games and updates to reviews of older games that were ported to Switch.

            <p><span>Mentioning <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/the-bards-tale/">The Bard's Tale</a> may conjure up images of the snarky comedy game from the mid-2000s, but developer IinXile's second attempt at the franchise (third if you count the VR offshoot The Mage's Tale) attempts to be much more faithful to the spirit of the original hardcore RPG series.</span></p>
